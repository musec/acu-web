The Avalon C++ Users group exists to local C++ knowledge among a community
of academics, students and professionals on the Avalon Peninsula
of Newfoundland.
We explore topics of interest to C++ programmers, including both specific
language features and generally-applicable development practices from a C++
perspective.
