We aim to meet approximately monthly throughout the year.
Once we've actually scheduled a few meetings, we'll list them here.

This would be a lunchtime session, with a 15-minute talk followed by Q&A,
with ample amounts of both formal discussion and informal chat.
The event will be open to all, but we especially welcome local academics,
graduate students and professional programmers.
