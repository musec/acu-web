title: Mailing list address fixed

My apologies if you've tried to subscribe to the mailing list over the past few
days: I had the wrong address posted for the list server!
You should actually
[email "subscribe avalon-cpp" to listserv@lists.mun.ca](mailto:listserv@lists.mun.ca?subject=subscribe%20avalon-cpp&body=subscribe%20avalon-cpp),
**not** listserv@morgan.ucs.mun.ca.

Once again, I'm sorry for the incorrect information.
