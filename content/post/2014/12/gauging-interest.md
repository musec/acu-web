Would you like to grow in your C++ (and general programming) proficiency?
The Avalon C++ Users group will provide a forum for programmers to meet,
learn new things and exchange ideas about writing good code
(especially in C++!).

We are tentatively planning on having our first meeting in
midâ€“late January 2015.
This would be a lunchtime session, with a 15-minute talk followed by Q&A,
with ample amounts of both formal discussion and informal chat.
The event will be open to all, but we especially welcome local academics,
graduate students and professional programmers.

If you are interested in attending, please fill out our
[Doodle poll](http://doodle.com/n2nc9q5ii8x2c9ea).
