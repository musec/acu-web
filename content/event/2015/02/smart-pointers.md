Our next meeting, on February 23rd, will feature a talk about
smart pointers in C++11.

<!--more-->

This might sound like an exaggeration, but once you get into the habit of using
them, these things are pretty life-changing!
Come hear for yourself to get your own evaluation of the level of hyperbole in
the preceeding statement.

After the talk there'll be time for questions and discussion.
Bring a lunch, and we'll see you there!
